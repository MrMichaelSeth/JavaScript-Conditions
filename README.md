# JavaScript Conditionals Activity

## Activity 1

Activiy should be done in groups, size 2-4. 

### Objective

Create an application that generates a random number and asks the user to guess that number

### Step 1

Write out the logic to accomplish this first. This will be your game plan for writing the solution with code

### Step 2

Choose a group memeber to **fork** this repository. Add all members as contributers to the new fork

### Step 3

All memebers should **clone** the new forked repository to their projects folder


Each of the following steps should be completed by a new group member.

### Step 4

1. Inside the repository, create a new file called "activity-1.html". 
2. Insert the global structure into the html file.
3. Create an external javascript file called "conditionals-1.js".
4. In Git, **add** and **commit** the new changes.
5. Use `git push` to push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub
6. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 4

1. Open *activity-1.html* and add a `<h1>` tag with the text "Activity 1".
2. Save and view the file in a web browser.
3. Using `<script>` link to the external javascript file.
4. Open *conditionals-1.js* and add `console.log("Let's do this!")`
5. Save and view in the web browser dev tools. What happens? (If nothing happens recheck you code)
6. Implement your pseudocode from **Step 1** above

## Activity 2

Activiy should be done in groups, size 2-4. 

### Objective

Create an application that asks the user to enter a number. If the number is divisible by 3,  alert 'chimi'. If the number is divisible by 5, alert 'changas'. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, alert 'chimichangas!`

### Step 1

Write out the logic to accomplish this first. This will be your game plan for writing the solution with code

### Step 2

1. Inside the repository, create a new file called *activity-2.html*.
2. Inside the repository, create a new file called *conditionals-2.js* and put it in the *js* folder
3. Open your code editor and create the global structure in site the HTML file
4. Add the `<script>` tag and connect your js file
5. In the body, create a div element with an id of "output"
4. Open *conditionals-2.js* and use console log to check if the js file is linked properly
6. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
7. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 3

1. Open *conditionals-2.js* and implement your logic from **Step 1**

## Activity 3

Activiy should be done in groups, size 2-4. 

### Objective

Create an application that asks the user for input and checks the input to validate it is a *number*. Display to the user if they entered a number or not

Hint: Research `typeOf`
### Step 1

### Step 2

1. Inside the repository, create a new file called *activity-3.html*.
2. Inside the repository, create a new file called *conditionals-3.js* and put it in the *js* folder
3. Open your code editor and create the global structure in site the HTML file
4. Add the `<script>` tag and connect your js file
5. In the body, create a div element with an id of "output"
4. Open *conditionals-3.js* and use console log to check if the js file is linked properly
6. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
7. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 3

1. Open *conditionals-3.js* and implement your logic from **Step 1**
